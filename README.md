# RubyChess

The classic game is here to play, on a simple, clean, terminal GUI.

Simply clone the repo, then run commands:

<code>$ cd RubyChess </code>
<br>
<code>$ ruby lib/game.rb </code>

- Enter the mode you wish to play
- Use the ARROWS to move the green selecting cursor
- Use ENTER to pick and place pieces

Enjoy!
